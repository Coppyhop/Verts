# Verts
Rogue-Like Vertical Shooter built in Java

Designed to be easily extensible and modifiable, this project aims to create a fun experience for everyone. While nowhere near a working state yet, progress should be visible over time.

The current goal is to get it up to a basic, working vertical shooter, and add the rogue-like elements after that.
