# Verts
Rogue-Like Vertical Shooter built in Java

# About
Welcome to Verts, the easily extensible, highly portable, and nowhere near working game/engine. Designed to be a fun vertical shooter, the game uses definition files to allow people to add or remove content as they please, allowing them to make their own unique experience with the game. While the system was designed to allow people to make mods, it could easily be used to design your own game entirely.
Unfortunately, it's nowhere near complete. You can't do much with it at the moment, but lots of work is going into development. We hope to have a very basic, but working shooter soon. Things like the shop, bosses, and story will be added later.
