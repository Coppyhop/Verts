This is the assets folder for the game, Inside each folder you will find the raw data for every asset, including music and sounds. This allows the game to be easily modifiable and configurable. However, there is something special about the gamedefs folder. This folder contains the files needed for the game to know what the sprites, sounds, and music do and where they go. You're welcome to explore these to figure out how to make your own, but it is not advised to change these unless you want a version of the game that is different than normal.
